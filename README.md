PatchDownloadSystem
===================
This will be a system to download patches by priority. This is useful for games that would like to have a Play While Still Downloading thing.

This is being developed as a proof of concept for myself. The code is messy and made without any standards. (E.G. Html and PHP is mixed just to speed things up a bit. There is no OOP etc etc.)
